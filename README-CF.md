## About

Tracks player taunts and displays who they taunted, what ability they used to taunt, and if it failed in some way.

### ⚠️ Midnight Compatibility

**Who Taunted does not work in WoW Midnight (12.0+).** Blizzard's combat API restrictions prevent addons from accessing real-time combat log data which is essential for this addon to function. See [Issue #77](https://github.com/Davie3/who-taunted/issues/77) for more details and my personal thoughts.

See Blizzard's blog post: [Combat Philosophy and Addon Disarmament in Midnight](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246290)

**Supported:**
- WoW Classic (TBC+)
- The War Within (11.x)

**Not Supported:**
- Midnight (12.0+) and future retail expansions unless Blizzard makes any changes
