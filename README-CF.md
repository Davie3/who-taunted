# [v2.0.4](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/4077638)
- Fixed a localization issue which caused options for Output types to not function correctly ([#15](https://github.com/Davie3/who-taunted/issues/15)).

# [v2.0.3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/4053235)
- Fixed a bug that would cause "You Are Not in Party" or similar system errors ([#12](https://github.com/Davie3/who-taunted/issues/12)).

# [v2.0.2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/4051037)
- 10.0/Dragonflight compatibility.

# [v2.0.1](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/4017737)
- Fixed a bug where errors were thrown in Classic when a player taunts. Some code from Mainline WoW was not compatible in Classic ([#8](https://github.com/Davie3/who-taunted/issues/8)).
- Fixed some issues with the Chat Window Options.
- Fixed a rare bug with the Taunt Output Options.

# [v2.0](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/3996658)
- 9.2.7 Compatibility.
- Wrath Classic 3.4.0 Support and Compatibility.
- TBC Classic 2.5.4 Support and Compatibility (for good measure if it comes back).
- Classic Era 1.14.3 Support and Compatibility.
- Updating all Version's Taunt Lists to the best of my ability.
- Adding AOE Taunt support for Monk's casting Provoke (115546) on Black Ox Statue (61146).
- Cleaning up and re-organizing the options menu.
- Profiles are now supported in the options menu.

# [v1.5](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/who-taunted/files/3081194)
- 9.0.1/Shadowlands compatibility.
- Removed Hunter's Distracting Shot.
- Re-added Warrior's Challenging Shout under AOE taunts
- Removed all options pertaining to changing the output of the Taunt messages. In 8.2.5, Blizzard protected the SendChatMessage function so this fixes any errors if the output type for WhoTaunted was set to anything other than "self". The default is now to display to the player (which is normal functionality). I will re-add the options if Blizzard makes any changes in the future.
